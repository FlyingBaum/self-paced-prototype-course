# self-paced-prototype-course

This repository includes the turtle package that was developed for my bachelor thesis in collaboration with complori GmbH. The turtle app is the prototype for a self-paced learning experience for children.

# Warning

This project cannot be run, it merely includes the code that was created for the turtle app inside the private `web-platform` repository of complori GmbH. It is supposed to be a public copy of the code that was written and not a standalone project.
